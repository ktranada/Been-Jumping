### Chun-Li: Leg Day is a JavaScript game I implemented with Phaser, a Desktop and Mobile HTML5 framework.

[It's live, play it here!](http://kvntrn.me/Been-Jumping/)

#### Backstory

Chun Li is currently in between Street Fighter tournaments at the moment, but her fitness never takes an off day.
In order to keep her legs in tip-top shape so she can kick tirelessly and furiously, everyday happens to be leg day.

Today is special though, she decided to practice box jumps on top of magical platforms in the clouds.
One weak, uncalculated jump is all it takes for her to fail.

**It is up to you to coach her and make sure she is ready for Street Fighter 5.**

#### How to play

1) Click and hold anywhere in the game to begin charging Chun Li's leg muscles.
2) When you think she's ready, release thy finger.
3) Soar through the heavens.


#### Notes

The `High Score` will only be your own. Because in life, you don't measure your success by evaluating another person's. You are your biggest challenge and you should strive to overcome it. That and I decided to use localStorage to keep track of scores.
